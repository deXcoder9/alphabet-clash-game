**Welcome to Typing Master, an engaging web-based typing game designed to enhance your typing skills while providing loads of fun! Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game challenges your speed and accuracy as you type the displayed keywords. Here's how it works:**

- Gameplay Mechanics: As keywords appear on the screen, your task is to type them correctly and quickly. For every correct entry, you score points. However, beware‚Äîmistakes are costly!

- Lives System: You start the game with three lives. Each incorrect keystroke results in the loss of one life. Once all lives are lost, the game is over.

- Scoring: The more accurately and swiftly you type, the higher your score. Challenge yourself to beat your previous records and climb the leaderboard!
